# Dify Mock Response Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem Fixed
The AI chat interface was showing "[MOCK WORKFLOW]" instead of connecting to the actual Dify API, even when proper API credentials were configured.

## Root Cause
1. Missing `.env` file with Dify API configuration
2. Overly aggressive fallback logic that always used mock responses when external API was unreachable
3. No distinction between development/testing mode and production mode

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration ✅
- Created `.env` file with proper Dify API credentials
- Added `VITE_DIFY_PRODUCTION_MODE=true` to disable mock fallbacks

### 2. Server Logic Updates ✅
- Added production mode check before falling back to mock responses
- Modified `/api/dify` and `/api/dify/workflow` endpoints
- Now returns proper HTTP 503 errors when Dify API is unavailable in production mode
- Preserves mock responses for development/testing when `VITE_DIFY_PRODUCTION_MODE=false`

### 3. Code Changes Made
- Updated `server.js` to check `VITE_DIFY_PRODUCTION_MODE` environment variable
- Modified error handling in both streaming and non-streaming endpoints
- Maintained backward compatibility for development environments

## Test Results ✅
- Workflow API: No longer returns "[MOCK WORKFLOW]" responses
- Chat API: No longer returns mock responses
- Both APIs now attempt real Dify API connections
- Proper error handling when API is unavailable
- Production-ready for environments with Dify API access

## Production Deployment
The fix is ready for production. In environments with proper network access to `api.dify.ai`, the chat interface will now connect to the real Dify API instead of showing mock responses.

**Environment Variables Required:**
```env
VITE_DIFY_API_URL=https://api.dify.ai/v1
VITE_DIFY_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
VITE_DIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_DIFY_PRODUCTION_MODE=true
```
